## Why Comprehensive Documentation Matters

1. **Enhanced Team Communication** – One canonical source of truth prevents “he-said-she-said” around feature scope.
2. **Knowledge Transfer** – Onboarding a new contributor takes hours, not days, when architecture & decisions are written down.
3. **Future Reference** – Months later, you can still recall API quotas or env-var names without trawling through commits.
4. **Project Efficiency** – Less time rediscovering context → more time coding, testing, delivering.
