# Stakeholder Analysis

| Stakeholder                                     | Role                  | Goals / Pain-points                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **End Users (students, tourists, researchers)** | Consume translations  | Needs accuracy, low latency, mobile UI              |
| **Instructor / Grader**                         | Evaluates deliverable | Looks for functional correctness & doc completeness |
| **Developer (project owner)**                   | Codes & maintains     | Wants clear build, deploy, and test scripts         |
| **Future Maintainers / Contributors**           | Add features          | Need understandable codebase & doc hierarchy        |
| **Google Cloud Platform**                       | API provider          | Seeks compliance with quota, auth, TOS              |
| **Vercel Platform**                             | Hosting provider      | Requires efficient build output & env-vars          |

_Rationale:_ Covering platform vendors clarifies external dependencies; including future maintainers highlights documentation value for knowledge transfer.
